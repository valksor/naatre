# Conformance fixtures

Fixtures are language-neutral JSON and are normative only for the versioned
profile named in each file. Every implementation must consume these files
directly and publish machine-readable results that bind the fixture digest,
implementation version, platform, and claimed profile.

Generated fixture changes must be reproducible byte-for-byte. Tests read the
checked-in files rather than duplicating their expected values in Go source.
